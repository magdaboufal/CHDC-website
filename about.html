      <p>
        In 10-20 years research we have found out that<strong>people with serious mental illnesses
          die 15-20 years before anybody else</strong>. For people of color the prospect
          is even worse.</p>

      <p>
        The Chicago Health Disparities Center is founded on the realization that
        in south-side Chicago there are huge ethnic health disparities. We carry
        on a program for African-americans with serious mental illness:
        <strong>for African-americans by african-americans.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Patrick Corrigan</strong> is a distinguished professor of
        psychology at Illinois Tech and the
        <strong>principal investigator at CHDC.</strong> He is a scientist, but
        he has been diagnosed with Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and
        Anxiety Disorder.
      </p>

      <p class="quote"><strong>I’m here as a scientist AND a peer</strong></p>

      <p>
        The Center stands thanks to the work of people like
        <strong>Lindsay Sheehan, a Senior Research Associate at CHDC.</strong>
        She makes sure that the flyers produced are understandable, posted in
        the right places, targeting the right audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sonya Ballentine</strong> is a Lived-Experience Research Leader
        at CHDC. She has been given the support needed to learn about research,
        ethics, and how to conduct valid scientific research, but she can make
        use of her own lived experience to enrich her work. She guides trainings
        to develop effective lived-experience research leader, providing
        guidance on topics such as: creating an agenda, how to follow a meeting,
        sticking to a timeline.
      </p>

      <p class="quote"><strong>The purpose is to connect with other individuals that are being
          positioned in positions of leadership</strong></p>

      <p>
        The center can count on a
        <strong>Community based participatory research team</strong> (CVPR).
        <strong>Ashley Skye</strong> became part of this team when she saw flyer
        for the leadership training one day when she was in therapy. Sonya
        Ballentine and guided her into a two day training where Ashely learned
        everything from starting a meeting, how to connect with disengaged
        people, working on a team, working with people with serious mental
        illness, avoiding stigmatized language, putting together proposal for
        grants, working with teams and community partners.
      </p>

      <p class="quote"><strong>What I love is that people with lived experiences actually have
          answers, and an experience that is valuable here…in research you need
          these people: people with serious mental illness that can inform your
          research…They shouldn’t be at the bottom, but part of the process. We
          need to see that we matter</strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>Noble</strong> is a CVPR Research Team Leader. This is currently
        his 4th year at the Center. He contributed to putting together a manual
        about how to do research, and how to get the community involved.
      </p>

      <p class="quote"><strong>It was confusing at first, but as I got more involved it became a
          place where I thought I could be useful in the community. Working on
          this project has helped me with my confidence, face some things I
          didn’t want to face, build character, bringing out the best in
          me</strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>Julius</strong> is a team research leader with lived experience
        His mental illness is in remission, and he is a valuable member of the
        Center.
      </p>

      <p class="quote"><strong>Sonya saw more in me than anybody else. She told me I have the
          combination of both: research knowledge AND experience of things that
          in a book you cannot learn.</strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>John Owens</strong> is on the Leadership Advisory Board with
        Lindsay Sheehan and Sonya Ballentine. The board is comprised of 6-8
        people, who work with African Americans challenged with mental illness
        with research project that help the community offering couching,
        mentoring, and leadership training.

        <strong>Marilyn Perez</strong> is a consumer team researcher She is part
        of the process through which the Center identifies Peer navigators. She
        interviews people, defines their eligibility, and help them get a job by
        creating a booklet that trains them. Training helps them get on their
        feet. They are hopeful, happy and they do good.
      </p>

      <p class="quote"><strong>I’m the voice for the people I worked with</strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong>DeAndre</strong> is a Research Assistant for African-Americans
        with serious mental illness. At this time the Center is training the first
        cohort of classes for which researchers developed a curriculum.
      </p>

      <p class="quote"><strong>I hadn’t been in a professional environment in a number of years.
          Mostly it was just about having a passion to be open-minded to learn
          more</strong></p>
