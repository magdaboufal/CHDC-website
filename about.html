    <section class="about">
    <p>In 10-20 years research we have found out that <strong>people with serious mental illnesses
    die 15-20 years before anybody else</strong>. For people of color the prospect is even
    worse.</p>

    <p>The Chicago Health Disparities Center is founded on the realization that in south-side
    Chicago there are huge ethnic health disparities.  We carry on a program for African-americans
    with serious mental illness: <strong>for African-americans by african-americans.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Patrick Corrigan is a distinguished professor of psychology at Illinois Tech and the
    principal investigator at CHDC.</strong> He is a scientist, but he has been diagnosed with Major
    Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder.</p>

    <p><strong class="quote">"I’m here as a scientist AND a peer"</strong></p>

    <p>The Center stands thanks to the work of people like <strong>Lindsay Sheehan, a Senior
    research associate at CHDC.</strong> She makes sure that the flyers produced are understandable,
    posted in the right places, targeting the right audience.</p>

    <p><strong>Sonya Ballentine</strong> is a Lived-Experience Research Leader at CHDC. She has been
    given the support needed to learn about research, ethics, and how to conduct valid scientific
    research, but she can make use of her own lived experience to enrich her work. She guides
    trainings to develop effective lived-experience research leader, providing guidance on topics
    such as: creating an agenda, how to follow a meeting, sticking to a timeline.</p>

    <p><strong class="quote">"The purpose is to connect with other individuals that are being positioned in
    positions of leadership."</strong></p>

    <p>The center can count on a <strong>Community based participatory research team</strong>(CVPR)</p>

    <p><strong>Ashley Skye</strong> became part of this team when she saw flyer for the leadership
    training one day when she was in therapy. Sonya Ballentine and guided her into a two day
    training where Ashely learned everything from starting a meeting, how to connect with disengaged
    people, working on a team, working with people with serious mental illness, avoiding stigmatized
    language, putting together proposal for grants, working with teams and community partners. </p>

    <p><strong class="quote">"What I love is that people with lived experiences actually have answers,
    and an experience that is valuable here…in research you need these people: people with serious
    mental illness that can inform your research…They shouldn’t be at the bottom, but part of the
    process. We need to see that we matter"</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Noble</strong> is a CVPR Research Team Leader This is currently his 4th year at the
    Center. He contributed to putting together a manual about how to do research, and how to get the
    community involved.</p>

    <p><strong class="quote">"It was confusing at first, but as I got more involved it became a place
    where I thought I could be useful in the community. Working on this project has helped me with
    my confidence, face some things I didn’t want to face, build character, bringing out the best in
    me"</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Julius</strong> is a team research leader with lived experience His mental illness is
    in remission, and he is a valuable member of the Center.</p>

    <p><strong class="quote">"Sonya saw more in me than anybody else. She told me I have the
    combination of both: research knowledge AND experience of things that in a book you cannot
    learn."</strong></p>

    <p><strong>John R Owens</strong> is on the Leadership Advisory Board with Lindsay Sheehan and
    Sonya Ballentine. The board is comprised of 6-8 people, who work with African Americans
    challenged with mental illness with research project that help the community offering couching,
    mentoring, and leadership training.</p>

    <p><strong>Marilyn Perez</strong> is  a consumer team researcher She is part of the process
    through which the Center identifies Peer navigators.  She interviews people, defines their
    eligibility, and help them get a job by creating a booklet that trains them. Training helps them
    get on their feet. They are hopeful, happy and they do good.</p>

    <p><strong class="quote">"I’m the voice for the people I worked with"</strong></p>

    <p><strong>DeAndre</strong> is a Research Assistant for African-Americans with serious mental
    illness. Right now the Center Is training the first cohort of classes for which researchers
    developed a curriculum. </p>

    <p><strong class="quote">"I hadn’t been in a professional environment in a number of years. Mostly
    it was just having a passion to be open minded to learn more."</strong></p>
